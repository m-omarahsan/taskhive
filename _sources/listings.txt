--------
Browsing
--------

Both offers and requests can be browsed with or without search filters. 
If filters are used, the criteria for filtering can include:

* Posts by a specific profile 
* Posts containing specified keyword(s) 
* Posts by profiles with specified ratings
* Tasks in a specific price range 
* Tasks in a specific category (e.g. development, writing, research)

-------------------
Keyword Suggestions
-------------------

Keywords from task offers and requests are recorded and saved locally, 
and used for keyword suggestion when posting a new task offer or 
request. This helps standardize keywords by promoting common 
terminology.



*Clients may opt-in to irregular broadcasting of keyword lists to the 
network for the benefit of newly installed clients*

-------------
Posting Tasks
-------------

Tasks are separated into two types – *offers* and *requests*.

Both offers and requests can contain optional information which helps 
potential clients be aware of the required terms, licenses and payment 
arrangements for a task before spending the effort to respond to the 
offer.

------
Offers
------

Offers are made by service providers. As the offer itself is not a 
binding contract, it may be as broad or specific in detail as desired. 
Offers are broadcast to the offer channel.

An example of an offer might be a 3D graphics designer offering their 
services to the community for a fee. The offer might include samples of 
their work, as well as their requested pay rate.

--------
Requests
--------

Requests are made by clients seeking task completion. As the request 
itself is not a binding contract, it may be as broad or specific in 
detail as desired. The more detailed a request is, the more information 
a service provider has to go on when judging whether or not the task is 
right for them.

*If the client is unsure of which contract template or license to 
choose, or what other details should be included, it is best to leave 
them out in the initial request. These details can be discussed with the 
service provider during negotiation, later adding them to the final 
agreement.*

----------
Categories
----------

Whether offers or requests, tasks fall into selected categories. Many 
categories have sub-categories for more specific organization. Some of 
these categories and sub-categories might include:


+-----------------------------+----------------------------------+
| Writing > Blogs > Science   | Editing > Proof-reading          |
+-----------------------------+----------------------------------+
| Design > Desktop Publishing | Voice acting > Female > Irish    |
| Development > Python        | Data entry > Email > Invoices    |
+-----------------------------+----------------------------------+
| Video editing > Mastering   | Research > Security > Pentesting |
+-----------------------------+----------------------------------+

Categories and sub-categories have 2-digit hexadecimal identifiers that 
are used when referencing them on the network. The Ids are compounded in 
a tree format for easy processing.

Writing / Editing    A1
   ∟ Blogs / Articles   22
      ∟ Science            CD

*Example category ID of A122CD*

-----------------
Size Restrictions
-----------------

Task titles and body can contain Unicode characters, but are limited in 
length to 640 and 6,400 bytes respectively. This cap attempts to provide 
the best user experience while limiting unnecessary spam, network 
traffic, and local CPU usage for proof-of-work calculations.

As the taskhive and bitmessage projects mature, these restriction may be 
removed or modified to better serve the network.

--------
Deadline
--------

This deadline is for receipt of deliverables upon receipt of payment 
from the client, and is EPOCH UTC. This is not to be confused with the 
expiry of the task offer/request, which is a maximum of 30 days from 
initial posting, whereas a task deadline could be infinite.

-------
Payment
-------

There are two payment related fields in a task – base currency and 
payment method. The base currency decides the fee that should be paid to 
a client for their services. The payment methods are multiple options 
for receiving said fee, and can range from bitcoin to bank wire, 
depending on the task, country, level of privacy and risk, etc.

----
Data
----

Task requests and offers have an identical JSON array format, differing 
only in task_type.

.. literalinclude:: task_data1.json
   :language: json 

For task terminate requests, only the bare verifiable identifying data 
is needed.

.. literalinclude:: task_data2.json
   :language: json
