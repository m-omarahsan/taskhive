Escrow
======

Among the various categories of services offered on Taskhive, there are 
professional escrow services. It is important to choose a well trusted 
escrow agent in the web-of-trust.

Escrow can be initiated by transacting parties to prevent fraud, make 
resolving future potential disputes easier, and to facilitate payment 
exchange.

It is recommended, but not required, to always use an escrow agent for 
large amounts, with untrusted service providers and clients, and to help 
strengthen your web-of-trust rating.

While not binding, clients and service providers may recommend escrow 
agents they are comfortable working with in the initial proposal phases. 
This can be changed to a different agent at a later date for various 
reasons (e.g. availability, more affordable rates, payment method 
incompatibilities, etc.).

Escrow Agents
-------------

As a free market, any profile can become an escrow agent at any time by 
registering as such in the web-of-trust. 

-------
Deposit
-------

Escrow agents must pay a deposit to the network of twice the amount 
intended to be handled at any given time (i.e. the amount they could 
steal). This deposit is made to an n-of-p bitcoin wallet signed by 
developers and the most trusted members of the community.
