Taskhive is a marketplace for freelance work. Instead of a centralized 
website that can be hacked, DDoSed or inevitably corrupted, Taskhive is 
a decentralized, p2p network and FOSS software, similar to BitTorrent, 
Tor or Bitcoin. *Anyone from anywhere can participate in the network and 
offer their services for free. Anyone can review and contribute to the 
code that makes it work. Taskhive is licensed under the AGPL.*
