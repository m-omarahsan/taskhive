Contracts
=========

Clients and service providers can manually create a new, edit or modify 
an existing contract template to suit their liking. To get started, the 
client is equipped with several basic fill-in-the-blanks contracts, and 
optionally a contract wizard that helps choose which contract is right 
for a task, and populate it with the necessary information.

Templates
---------

Contracts templates are available for a wide variety of purposes. 

Contract Renegotiations
-----------------------

Contracts can be renegotiated after agreement, assuming both parties key 
sign an amended contract. 

Unforeseen Circumstances
------------------------

Since available payment methods may change over time, only the base 
currency is binding in an offer, not the accepted payment methods.

It is always up to the client to find a way to pay in another accepted 
payment method if the proposed method becomes unavailable, to pay in the 
pegged base currency, and to involve an escrow to facilitate exchange if 
necessary.
