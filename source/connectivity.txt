Connectivity

Participation in the taskhive network requires a connection to the 
Bitmessage network. You can connect to the Bitmessage network over Tor 
or a trusted VPN for additional privacy.

Bitmessage

Bitmessage is presently the backbone of taskhive's message delivery and 
distributed database. Until a better, more robust solution is found, 
Bitmessage meets the privacy, anti-spam, distributed storage, and 
encryption needs of taskhive.

Bitmessage works by connecting to, and bouncing messages through nodes 
on the network until every node has received the same message. This 
everyone-receives-everything Private Information Retrieval (PIR) 
protocol is the only protocol that allows for information theoretic 
privacy.

Tor

Due to the potential for deanonymization attacks, it is recommended to 
additionally connect to the Bitmessage network through Tor. The taskhive 
client can be configured to do this automatically on both desktop and 
mobile.
